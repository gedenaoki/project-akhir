    <h2>How HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor Works & Interface It With Arduino</h2>
    <p>Give your next Arduino project bat-powers with the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor that can report the range of objects up to 13 feet away. This is a good thing to know when you’re trying to save your robot from hitting a wall.
        They are low power (suitable for battery operated devices), affordable, easy to interface and extremely popular with hobbyists.
        <br>
        HC-SR04 Hardware Overview
        An HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor actually consists of two ultrasonic transducers.
        <br>
        One acts as a transmitter that converts the electrical signal into 40 KHz ultrasonic sound pulses. The other acts as a receiver and listens for the transmitted pulses.
        <br>
        When the receiver receives these pulses, it produces an output pulse whose width is proportional to the distance of the object in front.
        <br>
        This sensor provides excellent non-contact range detection between 2 cm to 400 cm (~13 feet) with an accuracy of 3 mm.
        <br>
        Since it operates on 5 volts, it can be connected directly to an Arduino or any other 5V logic microcontroller.
        <br>
        How Does HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor Work?
        It all starts when the trigger pin is set HIGH for 10µs. In response, the sensor transmits an ultrasonic burst of eight pulses at 40 kHz. This 8-pulse pattern is specially designed so that the receiver can distinguish the transmitted pulses from ambient ultrasonic noise.
        <br>
        These eight ultrasonic pulses travel through the air away from the transmitter. Meanwhile the echo pin goes HIGH to initiate the echo-back signal.
        <br>
        If those pulses are not reflected back, the echo signal times out and goes low after 38ms (38 milliseconds). Thus a pulse of 38ms indicates no obstruction within the range of the sensor.
        <br>
        If those pulses are reflected back, the echo pin goes low as soon as the signal is received. This generates a pulse on the echo pin whose width varies from 150 µs to 25 ms depending on the time taken to receive the signal.
        <br>
        Calculating the Distance
        The width of the received pulse is used to calculate the distance from the reflected object. This can be worked out using the simple distance-speed-time equation we learned in high school. An easy way to remember the equation is to put the letters in a triangle.

    <h2>How HC-SR501 PIR Sensor Works & Interface It With Arduino</h2>
    <p>Whether you want to build a home burglar alarm or a trail camera, or perhaps you want to wake up animated Halloween props when trick-or-treaters come to your door, then you should definitely consider getting an HC-SR501 Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor for yourself.
    <br>
    The PIR sensor allows you to detect when a person or animal moves in or out of sensor range. This sensor is what you’ll find in most modern security systems, automatic light switches, garage door openers and similar applications where we want to react to motion.
    <br>
    Before getting into the nitty-gritty, let’s first understand how a PIR sensor actually works.
    How does a PIR sensor work?
    All objects, including the human body, at temperatures above absolute zero (0 Kelvin / -273.15 °C) emit heat energy in the form of infrared radiation. The hotter an object is, the more radiation it emits. This radiation is not visible to the human eye because it is emitted at infrared wavelengths. The PIR sensor is specifically designed to detect such levels of infrared radiation.</p>

    <h2>Interfacing DHT11 and DHT22 Sensors with Arduino</h2>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
        <div class="bold">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
</div>

    <p>Want to keep a log of the climate in your greenhouse, build a humidor control system, or track temperature and humidity data for a weather station project? AOSONG’s DHT11 or DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor could be the perfect fit for you!
    <br>
    These sensors are factory-calibrated and do not require any external components to function. With just a few connections and a bit of Arduino code, you can begin measuring relative humidity and temperature right away.
    <br>
    They provide temperature and humidity readings accurate to within one decimal place, which is a plus. The only drawback is that they only provide new data every second or two, but for the price and performance, it’s hard to complain.</p>

<div class="bold">
    <h2>DHT11 vs DHT22</h2>
</div>
    
    <p>The DHT11 and the DHT22 are the two most widely used sensors in the DHTxx series. They look kind of the same and have the same pinout, but their specs are different.
    <br>
    Of the two, the DHT22 is more expensive and, undoubtedly, has better specifications. The DHT22 can measure temperatures from -40°C to +125°C with an accuracy of ±0.5°C, while the DHT11 can measure temperatures from 0°C to 50°C with an accuracy of ±2°C. In addition, the DHT22 sensor can measure relative humidity from 0 to 100% with an accuracy of 2-5%, while the DHT11 sensor can only measure relative humidity from 20 to 80% with an accuracy of 5%.</p>

    <h2>Interface DHT11 Module With Arduino</h2>

    <p>Want to keep a log of the climate in your greenhouse, build a humidor control system, or track temperature and humidity data for a weather station project? AOSONG’s DHT11 Temperature and Humidity sensor module could be the perfect fit for you!
    <br>
    This sensor is factory-calibrated and does not require any external components to function. With just a few connections and a bit of Arduino code, you can begin measuring relative humidity and temperature right away.</p>

    <div class="bold">
    <h2>DHT11 Module Hardware Overview</h2>
</div>

    <p>At the heart of the module is the digital temperature and humidity sensor manufactured by AOSONG – DHT11.</p>

    <div class="bold">
    <h2>DHT11 Sensor</h2>
</div>

    <p>DHT11 can measure temperature from 0°C to 50°C with a ±2.0°C accuracy, and humidity from 20 to 80% with a 5% accuracy.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="IMG ARDUINO/sensorimg/dht11.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>Note that the DHT11 has a sampling rate of 1Hz, which means it can provide new data once every second.</p>

    <div class="bold">
    <h2>Supporting Circuitry</h2>
</div>

    <p>The module includes all of the necessary supporting circuitry, so it can be used straight out of the box.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/DHT11-Module-Hardware-Overview-Back.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>DHT11 sensors typically require an external 10K pull-up resistor on the output pin for proper communication between the sensor and the Arduino. However, because the module already includes a pull-up resistor, you do not need to add one.
    <br>
    The module also includes a decoupling capacitor for filtering power supply noise.</p>

    <div class="bold">
    <h2>Inside the DHT11 Sensor</h2>
    </div>

    <p>If you remove the sensor’s casing, you will find an NTC thermistor and a humidity sensing component inside.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/Inside-DHT11-Sensor-Front.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>The humidity sensing component has two electrodes with a moisture-holding substrate (usually a salt or conductive plastic polymer) in between.
    <br>
    As the humidity rises, the substrate absorbs water vapor, resulting in the release of ions and a decrease in the resistance between the two electrodes.
    <br>
    This change in resistance is proportional to the humidity, which can be measured to estimate relative humidity.</p>

    <h2>Interfacing AM2320 Temperature & Humidity Sensor with Arduino</h2>
    <p>Want to keep a log of the climate in your greenhouse, build a humidor control system, or track temperature and humidity data for a weather station project? The AM2320 Temperature & Humidity Sensor may be the right choice for you!
    <br>
    AM2320 sensor is factory-calibrated and requires few external components to work. So with just a few connections and some Arduino code, you can start measuring relative humidity and temperature right away.
    <br>
    Hardware Overview
    The AM2320 is a low-cost, easy to use, fairly accurate, digital temperature & humidity sensor, from AOSONG. It looks like the popular DHT11/DHT22 temperature and humidity sensors, but unlike classic DHT sensors, it has an I2C interface!
    The AM2320 sensor is capable of reading humidity over the full range of 0 to 100% RH with a typical accuracy of ±3% over the range of 20% to 80% RH (   0.024% RH resolution).
    <br>
    It has a maximum temperature range of -40 to 80°C and a typical accuracy of ±0.5°C at 25°C (0.01°C resolution).
    The AM2320 can output data at a maximum sampling rate of 0.5Hz i.e. one reading every two seconds.
    <br>
    Power Requirement
    The sensor itself uses 3.3V to 5.5V which makes it 3V or 5V compliant. So, you can use it with your favorite 3.3V or 5V microcontroller without worry.
    <br>
    The AM2320 consumes less than 0.95mA during measurements and less than 10µA during sleep mode. This low power consumption allow the implementation in battery driven devices such as handsets, wearables or smart watches.
    <br>
    I2C Interface
    The AM2320 is a I2C sensor, meaning it uses the two I2C data/clock wires available on most microcontrollers, and can share those pins with other I2C sensors as long as they don’t have an address collision.
    <br>
    The sensor has a fixed I2C address and is set to 0x5CHEX. A multiplexer/Mux is required to communicate to multiple AM2320 sensors on a single bus.</p>

    <h2>Interfacing LM35 Temperature Sensor with Arduino</h2>
    <p>One of the easiest and inexpensive ways to add temperature sensing in your Arduino project is to use LM35 Temperature Sensor. These sensors are fairly precise and needs no external components to work. So, with just a few connections and some Arduino code you’ll be sensing temperature in no time!
    <br>
    <br>
    LM35 Temperature Sensor
    The LM35 is a low voltage, precision centigrade temperature sensor manufactured by Texas Instruments. It is a chip that provides a voltage output that is linearly proportional to the temperature in °C and is, therefore, very easy to use with an Arduino.
    <br>
    The LM35 temperature sensor is fairly precise, never wears out, works under many environmental conditions and requires no external components to work. In addition, the LM35 sensor does not require calibration and provides a typical accuracy of ±0.5°C at room temperature and ±1°C over a full −55°C to +155°C temperature range.
    <br>
    The sensor can be powered with a 4V to 30V power supply and consumes less than 60µA during active temperature conversions, providing very low self-heating (less than 0.08°C in still air).
    <br>
    The only disadvantage of the LM35 sensor is that it requires a negative bias voltage to measure negative temperature. So if you are planning to use the sensor to measure negative temperature, it is recommended that you use TMP36 temperature sensor. The TMP36 by Analog Devices is fairly accurate (-40°C to 125°C) and has the advantage of being able to measure negative temperatures without the need for negative bias voltage. You can find a dedicated tutorial for the TMP36 below.
    <br>
    A better alternative to the LM35 is to use a digital temperature sensor like the DS18B20 which comes in the same package. Digital temperature sensors have better noise immunity which is useful when the sensor is placed at a distance or in an electrically noisy environment.
    Working Principle
    <br>
    The LM35 uses a solid-state technique to measure the temperature. It makes use of the fact that the voltage drop between the base and emitter (forward voltage – Vbe) of the Diode-connected transistor decreases at a known rate as the temperature increases. By precisely amplifying this voltage change, it is easy to generate an analog signal that is directly proportional to temperature.</p>

    <h2>How MQ2 Gas/Smoke Sensor Works? & Interface it with Arduino</h2>
    <p>Give your next Arduino project a nose for gasses by including the MQ2 gas sensor module. It is a versatile sensor that can detect LPG, smoke, alcohol, propane, hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide concentrations in the air.

    This makes the MQ2 Gas Sensor Module an excellent choice for building an indoor air quality monitoring system, a breathalyzer, or an early fire detection system.
    MQ2 Gas Sensor
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The MQ2 sensor is one of the most widely used in the MQ sensor series. It is a MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor. Metal oxide sensors are also known as Chemiresistors because sensing is based on the change in resistance of the sensing material when exposed to gasses.</p>
    <div class="gassensor">
    <img src="IMG ARDUINO/sensorimg/gassensor.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>
    The MQ2 gas sensor operates on 5V DC and consumes approximately 800mW. It can detect LPG, Smoke, Alcohol, Propane, Hydrogen, Methane and Carbon Monoxide concentrations ranging from 200 to 10000 ppm.

    <h2>How RCWL-0516 Microwave Radar Motion Sensor Works & Interface It With Arduino</h2>
    <p>For most of our Arduino projects that require knowing if someone has left or entered the area, the PIR sensor is an excellent choice. However, because they only detect movement from living things, they will generate fewer false alarms.
    <br>
    This is where a microwave sensor like the RCWL-0516 comes in handy. The RCWL-0516 microwave sensor detects any movement from any object and does not rely on heat signatures, making it more reliable in hot environments where a PIR sensor may not be as effective.
    <br>
    Before going into the nitty-gritty, let’s first understand how the RCWL-0516 sensor actually works.
    <br>
    <br>
    You may have seen police officers using radar speed guns to catch people driving too fast. These radar speed guns, like other types of radar, consist of a microwave transmitter and receiver. They send out a microwave signal and then receive it after it bounces off the target.
    <br>
    Due to the Doppler effect, if the object is moving towards or away from the gun, the frequency of the reflected microwave signal is different from that of the transmitted signal.</p>
    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="IMG ARDUINO/sensorimg/effectradar.webp" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>When a car approaches the radar, the frequency of the returned signal is greater than the frequency of the transmitted signal; when the car moves away, the frequency is lower.</p>

    <h2>How RCWL-0516 Microwave Radar Motion Sensor Works & Interface It With Arduino</h2>
    <p>For most of our Arduino projects that require knowing if someone has left or entered the area, the PIR sensor is an excellent choice. However, because they only detect movement from living things, they will generate fewer false alarms.
    <br>
    This is where a microwave sensor like the RCWL-0516 comes in handy. The RCWL-0516 microwave sensor detects any movement from any object and does not rely on heat signatures, making it more reliable in hot environments where a PIR sensor may not be as effective.
    <br>
    Before going into the nitty-gritty, let’s first understand how the RCWL-0516 sensor actually works.
    <br>
    How does Doppler radar work?
    The RCWL-0516 module employs “Doppler Radar” – a specialized radar that makes use of the Doppler Effect (also known as Doppler shift) to detect motion and trigger proximity alerts.
    <br>
    A Doppler radar works by bouncing a microwave signal off a desired target and reading the frequency of the returned signal. By analyzing how the target’s motion has altered the frequency of the transmitted signal, the target’s velocity can be measured.
    <br>
    You may have seen police officers using radar speed guns to catch people driving too fast. These radar speed guns, like other types of radar, consist of a microwave transmitter and receiver. They send out a microwave signal and then receive it after it bounces off the target.
    <br>
    Due to the Doppler effect, if the object is moving towards or away from the gun, the frequency of the reflected microwave signal is different from that of the transmitted signal.</p>
    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="IMG ARDUINO/sensorimg/effectradar.webp" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>When a car approaches the radar, the frequency of the returned signal is greater than the frequency of the transmitted signal; when the car moves away, the frequency is lower.</p>
    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="IMG ARDUINO/sensorimg/effectradar2.webp" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>Based on that difference, the radar speed gun calculates the speed of the car from which the signal bounced.</p>

    <h2>Interface One Channel Relay Module with Arduino</h2>
    <p>In your upcoming project, you might want to use your Arduino to control a high-voltage device, like a lamp, fan, or other household appliance. However, because the Arduino runs on 5 volts, it cannot directly control these high-voltage appliances.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is where relay modules come into play. These well-contained modules are inexpensive, simple to connect, and ideal for home-brew projects that require switching modest amounts of AC or DC power.

        <h2>How Do Relays Work?</h2>
    </div>

    <p>At the core of a relay is an electromagnet (a wire coil that becomes a temporary magnet when electricity is passed through it). A relay can be thought of as an electric lever; you turn it on with a relatively small current, and it turns on another device with a much larger current.</p>

        <h2>Relay Operation</h2>
    </div>

    <p>A relay typically has five pins, three of which are high voltage terminals (NC, COM, and NO) that connect to the device being controlled.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/relay-pinout.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>The device is connected between the COM (common) terminal and either the NC (normally closed) or NO (normally open) terminal, depending on whether the device should remain normally on or off.
    <br>
    Between the remaining two pins (coil1 and coil2) is a coil that acts as an electromagnet.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/relay-working-animation2.gif" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>Normally (initial position), the COM terminal is connected to the NC terminal and the NO terminal is open.
    <br>
    When current flows through the coil, the electromagnet becomes energized, causing the switch’s internal contact to move. The COM then connects to the NO terminal, disconnecting from the NC terminal.
    <br>
    When the current stops flowing through the coil, the internal contact is returned to its initial position, re-connecting the NC terminal to the COM and re-opening the NO terminal.
    <br>
    To put it another way, the relay functions as a single-pole-double-throw switch (SPDT).</p>

    <h2>Interface 4×3 & 4×4 Membrane Keypad with Arduino</h2>
    <p>Membrane keypads are an excellent starting point for adding key input to a project because they are inexpensive, long-lasting, and resistant to water. And knowing how to interface them with an Arduino is extremely useful for building a variety of projects that require user input for menu selection, password entry, or robot operation.
    <br>
    Membrane keypads come in a variety of sizes, the most common of which are the 4×3 keypad (12 keys) and the 4×4 keypad (16 keys). They have a layout similar to that of a standard telephone keypad, making them easy to use for anyone.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/4x3-4x4-Keypads.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>No matter what size they are, they all function identically. Let’s learn more about Membrane keypads.</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>Membrane Keypad Construction</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Membrane keypads are made of a thin, flexible membrane material and typically have six layers:</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/Membrane-Keypad-Construction.png">
    </div>

    <p>Graphic Overlay – Graphic overlays are typically made of polyester because it has better flex life than polycarbonate.
    <br>
    Metal Domes – This layer houses metal domes or polydomes that provide tactile feedback.
    <br>
    Top Circuit Layer – This is typically a polyester printed layer with silver-filled electrically conductive inks. This layer terminates as a flexible tail that connects to the outside world.
    <br>
    Spacer – This layer separates the top and bottom circuits, allowing the switch to remain normally open until the keypad is pressed.
    <br>
    Bottom Circuit Layer – This is typically a polyester printed layer with silver-filled electrically conductive inks. This layer also terminates as a flexible tail.
    <br>
    Rear Adhesive Layer – This layer sticks the keypad to almost anything, which is convenient.
    <br>
    If you peel the paper backing off the keypad, you can see how it is made.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/Internal-Conductive-Traces-of-4x3-Membrane-Keypad-On-Back-Side.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>In order to reduce the number of I/O connections, as you can see, all rows and columns are wired together. If this were not the case, interfacing 16 individual pushbuttons, for example, would require 17 I/O pins, one for each pushbutton and one for a common ground. By connecting rows and columns, only 8 pins are required to control the entire 4×4 keypad. This technique of controlling a large number of inputs using fewer pins is known as Multiplexing.</p>

    <h2>How Rotary Encoder Works and Interface It with Arduino</h2>
    <p>We are surrounded by rotary encoders without even realizing it, as they are used in so many everyday items, from printers and cameras to CNC machines and robots. The most common application of a rotary encoder is the volume knob on a car radio.
    <br>
    A rotary encoder is a type of position sensor that converts the angular position (rotation) of a knob into an output signal that can be used to determine which direction the knob is turned.
    <br>
    Rotary encoders are classified into two types: absolute and incremental. The absolute encoder reports the exact position of the knob in degrees, whereas the incremental encoder reports the number of increments the shaft has moved.
    <br>
    The rotary encoder used in this tutorial is of the incremental type.</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>Rotary Encoders Vs Potentiometers</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Rotary encoders are the modern digital equivalent of potentiometers and are more versatile.
    <br>
    Rotary encoders can rotate 360° without stopping, whereas potentiometers can only rotate 3/4 of the circle.
    <br>
    Potentiometers are used in situations where you need to know the exact position of the knob. Rotary encoders, on the other hand, are used in situations where you need to know the change in position rather than the exact position.</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>How Rotary Encoders Work?</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Inside the encoder is a slotted disc that is connected to pin C, the common ground. It also has two contact pins A and B, as shown below.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/rotary-encoder-internal-structure.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>When you turn the knob, A and B make contact with the common ground pin C in a specific order depending on which direction you turn the knob.
    <br>
    When they make contact with common ground, two signals are generated. These signals are 90° out of phase because one pin makes contact with common ground before the other. It is referred to as quadrature encoding.
    <br>
    When the knob is turned clockwise, the A pin connects to ground before the B pin. When the knob is turned anticlockwise, the B pin connects to ground before the A pin.
    <br>
    By monitoring when each pin connects or disconnects from ground, we can determine the direction in which the knob is being rotated. This can be accomplished by simply observing the state of B when A’s state changes.
    <br>
    When A changes state:
    <br>
    - if B != A, then the knob is turned clockwise.</p>

        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/rotary-encoder-output-pulses-in-clockwise-rotation.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>- if B = A, the knob is turned counterclockwise.</p>

    <h2>How 74HC595 Shift Register Works & Interface it with Arduino</h2>
    <p>One of the nice things about the Arduino is that it has a fair amount of I/O pins to work with. You can wire up a few buttons, sensors, servos, and so on, but as the list grows, you will quickly run out of pins.
    <br>
    The solution is to use a ‘shift register,’ which allows you to add more I/O pins to the Arduino (or any microcontroller). By far the most widely used shift register is the 74HC595, also known as just “595”.
    <br>
    The 74HC595 controls eight different output pins with only three input pins. If you need more than 8 I/O pins, you can daisychain as many shift registers as necessary to generate a large number of I/O pins.
    <br>
    The 74HC595 achieves this through a technique known as bit-shifting. If you are interested in learning more about bit-shifting, you will find this Wikipedia article extremely useful.</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>When Should You Use a Shift Register?</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Shift registers are often used to increase the number of I/O pins on a microcontroller.
    <br>
    For example, If your project needs to control 16 individual LEDs, you will, of course, require 16 pins of an Arduino, which is not possible. This is where the shift register comes in handy.
    <br>
    With two shift registers connected in series, you can control 16 LEDs with only three I/O pins. That is quite a difference, and the more shift registers you chain together, the more pins you’ll add. In theory, by daisy-chaining shift registers, an infinite number of I/O pins can be added.
    <br>
    The Original Nintendo Controller, released in 1985, is a practical application of a shift register. The main microcontroller of the Nintendo Entertainment System, used shift registers to gather button presses from the controller.</p>

    <h2>How 2-Axis Joystick Works & Interface with Arduino + Processing</h2>
    <p>When you hear the word thumb joystick, the first thing that comes to mind is a game controller. Although they are most commonly used for gaming, you can do a lot of cool things with them if you’re into DIY electronics, such as controlling a robot or rover or, controlling camera movement.
    <br>
    Let’s take a deeper dive into the joystick module and see how it works.</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>Hardware Overview</h2>
    </div>

    <p>Those who are familiar with the PS2 (PlayStation 2) controller will notice that this joystick is strikingly similar to the one used in that device. It is a self-centering spring-loaded joystick, which means that when you release it, it will center itself. It also has a comfortable cup-type knob/cap that feels like a thumb-stick.</p>

    <div class="currently">
        <h3>Potentiometers</h3>
    </div>

    <p>The basic idea behind a joystick is to convert the stick’s position on two axes — the X-axis (left to right) and the Y-axis (up and down) — into an electrical signal that a microcontroller can process. This is accomplished by incorporating two 5K potentiometers (one for each axis) connected with a gymbal mechanism that separates “horizontal” and “vertical” movements.</p>

    <p>The two gray boxes on either side of the joystick are the potentiometers. If you move the joystick while keeping an eye on the potentiometer, you’ll notice that each potentiometer only detects movement in one direction. We’ll go over how they work in more detail later.</p>

    <p>This joystick also has a momentary pushbutton switch (a small black box on one side of the joystick) that is actuated when you press the joystick knob. When the knob is pressed down, you’ll notice a lever pressing down on the switch’s head. It is designed in such a way that the lever operates regardless of the position of the joystick.</p>

    <h2>Interfacing Micro SD Card Module with Arduino</h2>
    <p>Every once in a while, you’ll come up with an Arduino project that needs a lot of data storage—whether it’s logging sensor data, saving files, or storing more information than the Arduino’s onboard memory can handle.
    <br>
    So, how do you manage all that data? The solution is likely something you already have in your digital camera or MP3 player: Flash Cards! These are often referred to as SD cards or microSD cards. They can hold gigabytes of data in a space smaller than a coin, making them a crucial part of our everyday tech.
    <br>
    A microSD card module makes it easy to interface your Arduino with a microSD card, making data storage in your next project a breeze. Let’s dive in and explore how!</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>Hardware Overview</h2>
    </div>

    <p>The key components of a microSD card module include:</p>

    <div class="currently">
        <h3>3.3V LDO Regulator</h3>
    </div>

    <p>A standard microSD card operates at 3.3V, which means it can’t be directly connected to circuits using 5V logic. In fact, any voltage above 3.6V could permanently damage the card. To prevent this, the module features an onboard ultra-low dropout voltage regulator that provides a stable 3.3V power supply, ensuring your microSD card operates safely.</p>

    <h2>Create Your Own CAN Network With MCP2515 Modules and Arduino</h2>
    <p>In the old days, cars had more than 2,000 meters of cable in them, connecting switches on the dashboard directly to the headlights and taillights, for instance. As cars became more complex, this simple logic would no longer work. In 1986, Bosch introduced the CAN bus system, which solved this problem and made car manufacturing cheaper and easier. CAN is now the industry standard and is used in everything from cars and trucks to buses and tractors, and even airplanes and ships.
    <br>
    Knowing how to read and parse CAN messages on your Arduino will allow you to obtain data from your car such as coolant temperature, throttle position, vehicle speed, and engine rpm, and use it in your in-dash projects.
    <br>
    The MCP2515 CAN Bus Interface Module is the best solution to add CAN connectivity to your Arduino with SPI interface. This tutorial will show you how to connect the MCP2515 module to an Arduino, but first, a quick primer on the CAN protocol.</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>Basics of CAN Bus System</h2>
    </div>

    <p>A Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is a communications standard designed to allow in-vehicle devices to communicate with each other without a host computer.
    <br>
    To better understand the CAN bus, think of your car as a human body. In this context, the CAN bus is the nervous system.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/CAN-Bus-Nervous-System-Analogy.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>Similar to how the nervous system allows communication between different parts of the body, the CAN bus allows communication between different CAN bus Nodes, also known as Electronic Control Units (or ECUs).
    <br>
    A modern car has over 70 ECUs, each of which is responsible for performing a specific task. Although these ECUs can perform a single task efficiently, they must share information with one another. For example, the engine control module sends the current engine speed to the instrument cluster, where it is displayed on a tachometer; similarly, the driver’s door controller sends a message to the passenger’s door controller to actuate the window.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/Car-ECU-CAN-Network.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>ECUs are connected to the bus in a multi-master configuration. Meaning, each ECU can take control of the bus and broadcast information (such as sensor data) over it. The broadcasted data is accepted by all other ECUs on the CAN bus. Each ECU can then read the data and decide whether to accept it or ignore it.</p>

    <h2>Interfacing Voltage Sensor with Arduino</h2>
    <p>The Arduino Uno, like many microcontrollers, has a built-in Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) that can convert an analog voltage on a pin to a digital number. However, the maximum analog input pin voltage is limited to 5V. You may find this limit inconvenient if your project requires measuring voltages exceeding 5V. In such cases, you could create a voltage divider using discrete resistors.
    <br>
    But there’s an easier way to measure voltages, especially if they’re lower than 25V: use a Voltage Sensor. It is a pre-made voltage divider circuit that uses precision resistors to provide accurate readings.
    <br>
    In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to use a voltage sensor with your Arduino to make your voltage measuring tasks simpler and more efficient. Let’s get started!</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>Hardware Overview</h2>
    </div>

    <p>The Voltage Sensor, in essence, is a simple voltage divider circuit composed of two resistors–nothing fancy.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/Voltage-Sensor-Hardware-Overview.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>The schematic of the Voltage Sensor is illustrated in the following image.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/Voltage-Sensor-Schematic.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>There are two resistors in this circuit. The resistor (R1) closest to the input voltage, has a value of 30 KΩ, and the resistor (R2) closest to ground, has a value of 7.5 KΩ. The voltage drop across R2 is our divided voltage. This signal is broken out to a header pin labeled S.
    <br>
    This simple circuit divides the input voltage by a factor of 5. That’s why this voltage sensor can help you measure voltages that are less than 25 volts with an Arduino.</p>

    <h2>Interfacing 16×2 Character LCD Module with Arduino</h2>
    <p>he Serial Monitor is a handy tool for viewing data from your Arduino, but what if you want to make your project portable and view sensor values without resorting to serial output? That’s where liquid crystal displays (LCDs) come in—they’re perfect for displaying messages or sensor readings on the go, or even adding a bit of visual flair to your Arduino project.
    <br>
    In this guide, we’ll walk you through setting up a 16×2 character LCD, as well as other character LCDs like 16×4, 16×1, 20×4, and more that use Hitachi’s HD44780 controller chip. Even if you’re new to this, don’t worry—we’ll go through everything step by step.
    <br>
    So grab your Arduino and LCD, and let’s get started on making your project a bit more interactive and a whole lot cooler!</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>Hardware Overview</h2>
    </div>

    <p>As the name suggests, character LCDs are specifically designed for displaying characters. A 16×2 character LCD, for example, can show 16 characters per line across two lines.
    <br>
    If you look closely, you can see tiny rectangles for each character on the screen as well as the pixels that make up a character. Each of these rectangles is a grid of 5×8 pixels.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/16x2-Character-LCD-5x8-Pixel-Matrix-Grid.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>Character LCDs come in a variety of sizes and colors, such as 16×1, 16×4, 20×4, with options like white text on a blue background or black text on a green background, and more.
    <br>
    At the core of the LCD is the Hitachi HD44780 controller chip. This chip takes care of generating the signals needed to drive the liquid crystals and managing the data displayed.
    <br>
    One of the great advantages of using these displays in your project is their “swappability”. You can easily replace one LCD with another LCD of a different size or color. While you may need to make slight adjustments to your code, the wiring will stay the same!</p>
</div>

<div id="contents2" class="content">
    <img src="IMG ARDUINO/displayimg/foto2.webp" alt="">
    <h2>Interface an I2C LCD with Arduino</h2>
    <p>If you’ve ever attempted to connect an LCD display to an Arduino, you’ve probably noticed that it uses a lot of Arduino pins. Even in 4-bit mode, the Arduino requires seven connections – half of the Arduino’s available digital I/O pins.
    <br>
    The solution is to use an I2C LCD display. It only uses two I/O pins that are not even part of the digital I/O pin set and can be shared with other I2C devices.</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>Hardware Overview</h2>
    </div>

    <p>A typical I2C LCD display consists of an HD44780-based character LCD display and an I2C LCD adapter. Let’s learn more about them.</p>

    <div class="currently">
        <h3>Character LCD Display</h3>
    </div>

    <p>As the name suggests, these LCDs are ideal for displaying only characters. A 16×2 character LCD, for example, can display 32 ASCII characters across two rows.</p>

    <h2>How Seven Segment Display Works & Interface it with Arduino</h2>
    <p>How many times have you seen a classic movie in which the hero has to defuse a ? The hero watches the display as time passes, each second more valuable than the last. Well, if you look closely, you’ll notice that all of the  in movies have seven-segment displays. It must be! How else could a hero know how much time he has left?
        <br>
    Perhaps you do not find seven-segment displays to be visually appealing, but they are the most efficient way to display numbers. They are simple to use, inexpensive, and highly visible in both low- and high-light conditions.
    <br>
    A real-world example of a seven-segment display is NASA’s famous countdown clock at Cape Canaveral, Florida, which was used for the Apollo landing.</p>

    <h2>Interface OLED Graphic Display Module with Arduino</h2>
    <p>Tired of using character LCD displays in your Arduino projects over and over? Well! They are, in fact, a thing of the past. Enter the fantastic OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) displays! They’re extremely light, almost paper-thin, theoretically flexible, and produce a brighter, crisper image.</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>Hardware Overview</h2>
    </div>

    <p>OLED displays are available in a range of sizes (such as 128×64, 128×32) and colors (such as white, blue, and dual-color OLEDs). Some OLED displays have an I2C interface, while others have an SPI interface.
        <br>
    One thing they all have in common, however, is that at their core is a powerful single-chip CMOS OLED driver controller – SSD1306, which handles all RAM buffering, requiring very little work from your Arduino.
    <br>
    In this tutorial, we’ll be using both I2C and SPI 0.96-inch 128×64 OLED displays. Don’t worry if your module is a different size or color; the information on this page is still useful.</p>

    <h2>Interfacing TM1637 4-Digit 7-Segment Display with Arduino</h2>
    <p>A 4-digit 7-segment display is a must-have for any project involving a clock, timer, or counter, but connecting a bare display to an Arduino requires a dozen-or-so pins, leaving little room for other sensors and modules.
    <br>
    Wouldn’t it be wonderful if you could control a 4-digit 7-segment display with fewer pins? This is where the TM1637 module enters the picture. It requires only four connections in total – two for power and two for controlling the display.</p>

<div id="contents6" class="content">
    <img src="IMG ARDUINO/displayimg/foto6.webp" alt="">
    <h2>Interfacing MAX7219 LED Dot Matrix Display with Arduino</h2>
    <p>Dot matrix displays are something that all Arduino enthusiasts come across at some point. These displays are so popular that almost all modern outdoor LED displays use them to display characters, symbols, and images.
    <br>
    When it comes to controlling dot-matrix displays, there is hardly a better option than the MAX7219. It can easily control a single dot matrix and, for larger projects, it can be chained together to control two or more dot matrices.
    <br>
    All in all, they are a lot of fun and quite useful as well, so let’s get started.</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>MAX7219 Module Overview</h2>
    </div>

    <p>There are several MAX7219 breakout boards available, two of which are more popular: the generic module and the FC-16 module.</p>

    <br>
    As technology progressed, these displays found a new place in the world of DIY. They quickly gained popularity among hobbyists due to their small size (about 1.5″), low cost, ease of use, low power consumption, and ability to display text as well as bitmaps.</p>

    <h2>Controlling WS2812B Addressable LEDs with Arduino</h2>
    <p>Whether you call them individually addressable RGB LEDs, WS2812B, or NeoPixels, there’s no denying that they are extremely popular and a must-have for any glowy and blinky project.
    <br>
    What sets these LEDs apart is their unique feature that allows you to individually address and control the color and brightness of each LED on a strip. Plus, you can (theoretically) chain as many LEDs as you want and control them all using a single microcontroller pin. The more LEDs you chain together, the more fancier your animations will be!
    <br>
    These LEDs are exceptionally bright, produce vibrant colors, and are easy to hookup. This tutorial explains everything you need to know about WS2812B addressable LEDs and how to use them with an Arduino.</p>

    <h2>How Servo Motor Works & Interface It With Arduino</h2>
    <p>There are many motors to pick from, but it’s important to pick the right one for the job. If your project requires precise positioning, a servo motor is usually the best option. Instruct them where to point, and they’ll do it for you. It’s as simple as that!
        <br>
    They’re useful in a variety of robotics projects, such as steering an RC model’s front wheels or pivoting a sensor on a robotic vehicle.</p>

    <h2>Control 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor with ULN2003 Driver & Arduino
</h2>
    <p>We are surrounded by stepper motors without even realizing it, as they are used in so many everyday items, including window blinds, 3D printers, DVD players, security cameras, and CNC machines. We’re a lot closer to stepper motors than you think.
<br>
    Stepper motors fall somewhere between a conventional DC motor and a servo motor. They can rotate continuously like DC motors and be positioned precisely (in discrete steps) like servo motors.
<br>
    If you’re just getting started with stepper motors, the 28BYJ-48 is a great choice. They typically come with a ULN2003-based driver board, making them very simple to use.</p>

    <h2>Control Stepper Motor with L298N Motor Driver & Arduino</h2>
    <p>If you are planning on assembling your new robot, you will eventually want to learn how to control stepper motors. The easiest and inexpensive way to control stepper motors is to use the L298N motor driver. It can control both the speed and the spinning direction of any small to medium sized bipolar stepper motor such as the NEMA 17.

    <h2>Controlling DC Motors with DRV8833 Motor Driver and Arduino</h2>
    <p>Without a doubt, L293D and L298N are the go-to motor drivers for Arduino projects. They are reliable and have been used in hundreds, if not thousands, of projects. However, they have a major downside – they use bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), which makes them extremely inefficient.
<br>
    The issue with BJTs is that they have an on-state voltage drop. The energy from that voltage needs to go somewhere, and it indeed does; it dissipates as heat. Over time, this can result in a considerable amount of energy loss and, in some cases, cause the driver to overheat. This can be a significant disadvantage for projects that must run for extended periods of time.
<br>
    Thankfully, modern motor drivers like the DRV8833 really shine when it comes to efficiency. Instead of using BJTs, the DRV8833 uses MOSFETs. MOSFETs have almost negligible voltage drop, meaning that nearly all the voltage from the power supply is delivered to the motor. That is why the DRV8833 is not only more energy-efficient than BJT-based motor drivers, but it also generates far less heat, making it safer to use for longer periods.</p>

    <h2>Control Stepper Motor with A4988 Driver Module & Arduino</h2>
    <p>For single-stepper-motor applications, a driver like the L298N is fine, but if you want to construct your own CNC machine or 3D printer, you’ll need a dedicated stepper motor driver like the A4988.
<br>
    Due to the simplicity of the step motor control and the variety of stepping modes provided by the A4988 driver, it is an ideal solution for building applications that require precise and reliable stepper motor control, such as the movement control of beds, heads, and assemblies in various CNC plotting, milling, and 3D printer designs.
<br>
    The fact that it only requires two pins to control the speed and direction of a bipolar stepper motor like the NEMA 17 is pretty neat, too.</p>

    <h2>Interfacing HC05 Bluetooth Module with Arduino</h2>
    <p>Bluetooth is everywhere nowadays. It’s a word we hear all the time and is in millions of products we use everyday, including headsets, cellphones, laptops, game controllers, activity trackers, and so on.
    <br>
    In our world of embedded electronics, Bluetooth serves as an excellent way to transmit small amounts of data wirelessly over short distances (less than 100 meters). It can be used for real-time data logging, or controlling a project using a smartphone.
    <br>
    One of the most affordable and widely used Bluetooth modules is the HC-05. You can easily find it for around $5 online, making it a budget-friendly option to add Bluetooth connectivity to your project. No more tangled cables and messy wires!
    <br>
    In this tutorial, we’ll help you get started with the HC-05. But we don’t want to overwhelm you with too much information at once, so we’ll split it into three easy-to-follow tutorials. This first tutorial will show you how to send and receive data between the HC-05 and your smartphone. In the next tutorial, we’ll teach you how to configure the HC-05 using AT commands. And in the final tutorial, you’ll learn how to make two Arduino boards communicate wirelessly using HC-05 Bluetooth modules.
    <br>
    By the end of these tutorials, you’ll have a good understanding of using the HC-05 Bluetooth module in your projects. So, let’s get started!</p>

    <h2>Configuring the HC-05 using AT commands</h2>
    <p>Anyone tinkering with the HC-05 bluetooth module will eventually have to use what are called “AT commands”. AT commands are simple text-based commands that follow the “AT” prefix (“AT” meaning ‘attention’). These commands are similar to the ones used with old modem devices. By sending specific AT commands to the HC-05 module, you can configure it or retrieve basic information about it, such as its name, baud rate, PIN code, role, and so on.
