    <h2>Getting Started with ESP8266</h2>
    <p>In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a hot topic in the tech industry. It has altered the way we work. Physical objects and the digital world are more intertwined than ever before.
    <br>
    With this in mind, in 2014, Espressif Systems released the incredibly tiny and inexpensive WiFi-enabled microcontroller – The ESP8266. It costs less than $3 and can monitor and control things from anywhere in the world, making it ideal for almost any IoT application.</p>
</div>

<div id="content2" class="content">
    <img src="IMG/esp2.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Installing ESP8266 Board in the Arduino IDE</h2>
    <p>
    There are several development platforms available for programming the ESP8266. You can go with:
    <br>
    <br>
    - Arduino IDE – intended for those who are familiar with Arduino<br>
    - Espruino – JavaScript SDK and firmware closely emulating Node.js<br>
    - Mongoose OS – An operating system for IoT devices that is recommended by Espressif Systems and Google Cloud IoT<br>
    - MicroPython – Implementation of Python 3 for microcontrollers<br>
    - SDK provided by Espressif – Official SDK to take advantage of all ESP8266 features
    </p>
</div>

<div id="content3" class="content">
    <img src="IMG/esp11.jpeg" alt="">
    <h2>ESP8266 Pinout Reference</h2>
    <p>One of the nice things about the ESP8266 is that it has a fair amount of GPIO pins to work with. You won’t have to juggle or multiplex your IO pins. However, there are a few things to keep in mind, so please read the pinout carefully.</p>
</div>

<div id="content4" class="content">
    <img src="IMG/esp3.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Create A Simple ESP8266 NodeMCU Web Server In Arduino IDE</h2>
    <p>In recent years, the ESP8266 has risen to prominence in IoT and WiFi-related projects. It’s a low-cost WiFi module that, with a little extra effort, can be programmed to run a standalone web server. What a cool thing!
    </p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>ESP8266 Operating Modes</h2>
    </div>

    <p>One of the most useful features of the ESP8266 is its ability to not only connect to an existing WiFi network and act as a Web Server, but also to create its own network, allowing other devices to connect directly to it and access web pages.
    <br>
    This is possible because the ESP8266 can operate in three modes: Station (STA) mode, Soft Access Point (AP) mode, and both simultaneously.</p>

    <div class="currently">
        <h3>Station (STA) Mode</h3>
    </div>

    <p>In Station (STA) mode, the ESP8266 connects to an existing WiFi network (the one created by your wireless router).</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/ESP8266-NodeMCU-Web-Server-Station-STA-Mode-Demonstration.png" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>In STA mode, the ESP8266 obtains an IP address from the wireless router to which it is connected. With this IP address, it can set up a web server and serve web pages to all connected devices on the existing WiFi network.</p>
</div>

<div id="content5" class="content">
    <img src="IMG/esp6.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Configuring & Handling ESP8266 GPIO Interrupts In Arduino IDE</h2>
    <p>Often in a project you want the ESP8266 to perform its normal program while continuously monitoring for some kind of event. One widely adopted solution for this is the use of interrupts.
    <br>
    Interrupts can be classified into two types.
    <br>
    Hardware interrupts – These occur in response to an external event. For example, a GPIO interrupt (when a key is pressed).
    <br>
    Software Interrupts – These occur in response to a software instruction. For example, a simple timer interrupt or a watchdog timer interrupt (when the timer times out).</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>ESP8266 GPIO Interrupt</h2>
    </div>

    <p>You can configure the ESP8266 to generate an interrupt when a GPIO pin changes its logic level.
    <br>
    All GPIO pins in an ESP8266 board can be configured to act as interrupt request inputs, except GPIO16.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/iot/ESP8266-Interrupt-Pins.png" alt="">
    </div>
</div>

<div id="content6" class="content">
    <img src="IMG/esp8.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>ESP8266 Over The Air (OTA) Programming In Arduino IDE</h2>
    <p>One of the best things about ESP8266 is that its firmware can be updated wirelessly. This kind of programming is called “Over-The-Air” (OTA).</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>What is OTA programming in ESP8266?</h2>
    </div>

    <p><a href="#">OTA programming</a>lets you update/upload a new program to the ESP8266 over Wi-Fi without having to connect the ESP8266 to the computer via USB.
    <br>
    The OTA functionality comes in handy when there is no physical access to the ESP module. In addition, it reduces the time required to update each ESP module during maintenance.
    <br>
    One key advantage of OTA is that a single central location can send an update to multiple ESPs on the same network.
    <br>
    The only disadvantage is that you must include an OTA code with each sketch you upload in order to use OTA in the next update.</p>
</div>

<div id="content7" class="content">
    <img src="IMG/esp7.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Getting Date & Time From NTP Server With ESP8266 NodeMCU</h2>
    <p>Every now and then, you’ll come across an idea where keeping time is a top priority. For example, consider a relay that must be activated at a specific time or a data logger that must store values at precise intervals.
    <br>
    The first thing that comes to mind is to use an RTC (Real Time Clock) chip. However, because these chips are not perfectly accurate, you must perform manual adjustments on a regular basis to keep them synchronized.
    <br>
    Instead, it is preferable to employ the Network Time Protocol (NTP). If your ESP8266 project has Internet access, you can obtain date and time (with a precision of a few milliseconds of UTC) for FREE. Also, you don’t need any additional hardware.</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>What is an NTP?</h2>
    </div>

    <p>NTP is an abbreviation for <a href="#">Network Time Protocol</a>. It is a standard Internet Protocol (IP) for synchronizing computer clocks over a network.
    <br>
    This protocol synchronizes all networked devices to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) within a few milliseconds ( 50 milliseconds over the public Internet and under 5 milliseconds in a LAN environment).
    <br>
    Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is a global time standard that is similar to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). UTC does not change; it is the same all over the world.
    <br>
    The idea here is to use NTP to set the computer clocks to UTC and then apply any local time zone offset or daylight saving time offset. This allows us to synchronize our computer clocks regardless of location or time zone differences.</p>

    <h2>Control WS2812B Addressable LEDs with ESP8266 and WLED</h2>
    <p>Whether you call them individually addressable RGB LEDs, WS2812B, or NeoPixels, there’s no denying that they are extremely popular and a must-have for any glowy and blinky project.
    <br>
    Writing code to control addressable LEDs isn’t difficult, but what if you just want to add some ambient lighting to your living room or office and manage it all from your smartphone? Currently the best option, hands down, is WLED—A free, feature-rich, open-source mobile app that gives us complete command over a wide variety of RGB LEDs.
    <br>
    The WLED app makes controlling individually addressable LEDs much simpler, convenient, and—most importantly—fun. This app is just too cool not to try.
    <br>
    In this tutorial, we will learn how to install WLED on an ESP8266 board and use it to control a string of addressable LEDs.</p>

    <h2>Interface DHT11 DHT22 w/ ESP8266 NodeMCU Using Web Server</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wished you could use your mobile, tablet, or PC to monitor the temperature and humidity in your home, walk-in cooler, or wine cellar at any time? Then this IoT project could be a great place to start!
    <br>
    This project employs the ESP8266 NodeMCU as the control device, which connects to an existing WiFi network and creates a Web Server. When a device connects to this web server, the ESP8266 will read the temperature and relative humidity from the DHT11/DHT22 sensor and send it to the device’s web browser with a nice interface. Excited? Let’s get started!</p>

    <h2>How to Use an I2C LCD Display With ESP8266</h2>
    <p>Want to display sensor readings in your ESP8266 projects without resorting to serial output? Then an I2C LCD display might be a better choice for you! It consumes only two GPIO pins which can also be shared with other I2C devices.</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>Hardware Overview</h2>
    </div>

    <p>A typical I2C LCD display consists of an HD44780 based character LCD display and an I2C LCD adapter. Let us get to know them one by one.</p>
</div>

    <h2>Interface OLED Graphic Display Module with ESP8266 NodeMCU</h2>
    <p>Do you want to spice up your ESP8266 IoT projects with some graphics? Or perhaps you want to display the IP address of your ESP8266 without resorting to the serial output. These incredibly cool OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) displays may be just what you need! They’re extremely light, almost paper-thin, theoretically flexible, and produce a brighter, crisper image.</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>OLED Display Module Overview</h2>
    </div>

    <p>OLED displays are available in a range of sizes (such as 128×64, 128×32) and colors (such as white, blue, and dual-color OLEDs). Some OLED displays have an I2C interface, while others have an SPI interface.
    <br>
    In this tutorial, we’ll be using a 0.96-inch 128×64 I2C OLED display. Don’t worry if your module is a different size or color; the information on this page is still useful.</p>

    <div class="effectradar">
        <img src="https://lastminuteengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/arduino/128x64-Blue-I2C-OLED-Display.jpg" alt="">
    </div>

    <p>At the heart of the module is a powerful single-chip CMOS OLED driver controller – SSD1306, which handles all RAM buffering, requiring very little work from your ESP8266. Also, the SSD1306 controller’s operating voltage ranges from 1.65V to 3.3V, making it ideal for interfacing with 3.3V microcontrollers such as the ESP8266.
    <br>
    An OLED display, unlike a character LCD display, does not require a backlight because it generates its own light. This explains the display’s high contrast, extremely wide viewing angle, and ability to display deep <a href="#">black levels</a>.
    <br>
    The absence of a backlight reduces power consumption significantly. A typical OLED display uses about 20mA on average, though this varies depending on how much of the display is lit.
    <br>
    Because of their high contrast, these OLED displays are highly readable and can display impressively detailed graphics.</p>

    <h2>Display Values of Multiple DS18B20s on ESP8266 NodeMCU Web Server</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wanted to have sensors scattered all around your house and garden reporting their temperature regularly to a central server? Then, this IoT project might be the solid launching point for you!
    <br>
    This project uses ESP8266 NodeMCU as the control device that easily connects to existing WiFi network & creates a Web Server. When any connected device accesses this web server, ESP8266 reads in temperature from multiple DS18B20 Temperature sensors & sends it to the web browser of that device with a nice interface. Excited? Let’s get started!</p>

    <div class="bold">
        <h2>Multiple DS18B20s On Single Bus</h2>
    </div>

    <p>One of the biggest features of DS18B20 is that multiple DS18B20s can coexist on the same 1-Wire bus. As each DS18B20 has a unique 64-bit serial code burned in at the factory, it’s easier to differentiate them from one another.
    <br>
    This feature can be a huge advantage when you want to control many DS18B20s distributed over a large area. In this tutorial we are going to do the same.</p>

    <br>
    This project uses ESP8266 NodeMCU as the control device that easily connects to existing WiFi network & creates a Web Server. When any connected device accesses this web server, ESP8266 reads in temperature, humidity, barometric pressure & altitude from BME280 & sends it to the web browser of that device with a nice interface.
